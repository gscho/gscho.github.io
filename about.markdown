<h1> About Me </h1>
Hi I'm Greg! I'm based in Ontario Canada and currently work as a Customer Success Architect for GitHub.

Before joining GitHub, I spent 6 years working in professional services providing solutions as a Software Developer, DevOps Engineer and Customer Architect.

I'm most interested in solutions architecture, CI/CD and build & release management.
